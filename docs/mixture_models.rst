Mixture Models
===========================
Mixture models are used to infer properties about sub-populations when presented with pooled population data. Several applications such as topic modeling, clustering, and rich-prior distribtion selection can be handled with mixture models. *DMLearn* offers a flexible implementation of the mixture model. *DMLearn*'s mixture model API combined  with :doc:`base distributions <base_distributions>` and :doc:`combinators <combinators>`.` allows for the specification of deep nested graphical models on heterogenous data types.
